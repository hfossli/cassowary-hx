cassowary.hx
============

**important**

- This code was a direct port of [cassowary.js](https://github.com/slightlyoff/cassowary.js/) 
- The code is behind current master of cassowary.js by a bit
- The code is not really optimized for Haxe (as it was born in js)

While the port is complete in a sense,    
I have moved on to a new port and implementation and don't consider this port ideal.
