cassowary.hx
============

A direct Haxe port of the cassowary.js implementation of the Cassowary constraint solving algorithm. The port includes minor changes to the js born API to deal with the changes to a strong typed language. The port also includes and passes all the original js version test cases.

**important**

- This code was a direct port of [cassowary.js](https://github.com/slightlyoff/cassowary.js/) 
- The code may be behind current cassowary.js by a bit
- The code is not fully optimized for Haxe (as it was born in js)

**future**

While the port is complete, I have since moved on to a smaller, cleaner, stronger typed port and implementation. When uploaded, I'll link to the new version instead.
